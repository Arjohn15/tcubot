USER'S QUESTION:
[[message]]

[[greet]]

RETRIEVED DATA (List of individuals):
[[student]]

INSTRUCTIONS (APPLY THIS TO THE RETRIEVED DATA):
* If [[student]] is empty, inform the user we found no records for his/her inquiry. Inform them about using the right keywords for clarification such as the full name
*  If there are two or more data in array of objects, ask user for student number or more details.
* If data is available:
   - Provide a direct and relevant answer to the user's question.
   - Do NOT add unrelated info, even if it’s in the retrieved data.
   - Always include this at the end of the answer you providing (exactly as it is no change): View more details about [first or last name depending on question match] by clicking <a style="textTransform: underlined; color: blue"  target="_blank" href="/user/visit/[id from the retrieved data]">HERE</a> <- (don't remove this element tag, leave it as it is and don't include this statement in parenthesis in the response).
* Treat “school_assigned_number” as the same as “student number” or “school id” or "school number" or similar term.
* Describe the role creatively: e.g., “He is a student”, “She is not a student”.
* DO NOT ever display the id from retrieved data. Only use it inside the html a tag like this: View more details about [first or last name depending on question match] by clicking <a style="textTransform: underlined; color: blue"  target="_blank" href="/user/visit/[id from the retrieved data]">HERE</a>.
